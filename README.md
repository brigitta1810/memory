Memory game

#To build this memory game, I used the given HTML and CSS files but modified the CSS a bit with different background, colors and different symbols.

#In the Java Script part, I followed the game logic explained in the instructions.

#In order to make the game work, variables had to be declared, using also selectors. 

#The symbols/pictures on the card have been declared as an arrow, which made it possible to shuffle them. 

#Several functions have been created, for example:

- the startGame function, which shuffles the cards, sets moves to zero, time to zero and sets stars to 3

- the shuffle function shuffles the card

- the startTime function makes timer work on the score panel

- the resetTimer function makes timer start from 0

- the rateGame function makes sure the star rating changes based on the specified number of moves

- the endGame function makes game end and a message pop up congratulating the player and asking if he/she wants to play again

#The game has been optimized to work well and look good on all devices (details in responsive.css)
